# BrickadiaUtils
Dedicated server utilities suite for the game Brickadia

Research is currently being done into a solution based on Node.js where the dedicated server is spawned as a child process. From there, we could hook into the console and create scripts, or 'mods', that can read the server console and execute automated commands. Security is the major concern with this solution and must be accounted for before anything is considered release-rady.
